    Devices
  </h2>
  <p>
    A device represents, intuitively, a particular piece of hardware. It is uniquely identified by a set of identity attributes (MAC addresses, user-defined UIDs, etc.); think of it as an extension of a unique identifier into a multi-attribute structure.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Device groups
  </h2>
  A device group represents a set of devices sharing the same set of attributes. Device groups can either be static or dynamic, where static and dynamic refer to the device membership status.
  <h3>
    Static groups
  </h3>
  Static device groups consist of devices with the same group attribute and can only be extended by explicit assignment of the group to the device through the API.

  <br />
  <h3>
    Dynamic groups
  </h3>
  Unlike static groups, dynamic group membership is defined by matching a set of filters on the device inventory attributes. Since these attribute values might change over time, a device might match different groups because of changing attribute values, thus leading to the group changing dynamically.
